# Digital CV Streamlit App

This project demonstrates a digital CV built with **Streamlit**, a Python library that makes it easy to create web applications. The app is designed to display your personal details, skills, experience, and more, in an interactive and visually appealing format.

The app uses the following libraries:

- **Streamlit**: A powerful library for creating web applications with minimal effort.
- **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork that allows you to work with images.
- **CSS (in the `style` folder)**: Custom CSS styles for improving the app's design.
